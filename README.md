# HIP35


## Some cool facts

* HP35 was the first ever scientific pocket calculator. It was
  released in 1972. Before that, the only practical portable
  devices for performing trigonometric and exponential functions
  were slide rules [1].
* The co-founder of HP himself, Bill Hewlett, challenged his coworkers
  to create it as a "shirt-pocket sized HP-9100â€œ (HP-9100 was a
  scientific computer from the 60s).
* HP-35 calculators, were used by NASA's Skylab crew from 1973 to 1974
  [2]. It's rumored to be the first calculator to ever fly into space.
  It helped the crew write programs that perform calculations related
  to the spacecraft's orbit around the moon (Lunar Orbital Rendezvous
  or LOR).
* It was able to perform calculations both in algebraic and Reverse
  Polish Notation (RPN) mode.
