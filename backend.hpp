/**
* @brief Implements a reverse Polish notation (RPN) calculator [1].
*        The architecture more or less follows the basic architecture
*        of the HP35 calculator. It contains a stack of 4 registers;
*        X, Y, Z and T (T for top, X for bottom). Therefore when we store
*        a number, it's written to the X register. It also contains
*        a LASTX register which stores the last value of X before a
*        function button is pressed.The calculator supports the
*        following basic operations blueprinted in the `IBackend`
*        class such as:
*        - `SwapXY`
*        - `Peek`
*        - `Insert`
*        - `Rdn` (Rotate down)
*        - `Enter`
*
*        RPN notation heavily relies on the stack. When we enter
*        an operand, it's pushed at the bottom of its stack. When
*        an operation is made, it takes place on the stack.
*        Operations are not stored anywhere and simply manipulate
*        the stack. An operation (e.g. +, SIN, etc.) always follows
*        its operand(s) and when it's complete the bottom of the
*        stack gets overwritten with its result.
*        Below is an example to give you some intuition:
*        `4 * (3 + 2)` or in RPN  `4 3 2 + *`; we do `3+2` first, 
*        then `4*5`:
*        @verbatim
*        4 3 2 + *
*          |     |    |     |    |  4  |   |     |   |     |
*        4 |     | 3  |  4  | 2  |  3  | + |  4  | * |     | <- Y
*          |  4  |    |  3  |    |  2  |   |  5  |   | 20  | <- X
*          +-----+    +-----+    +-----+   +-----+   +-----+ 
*        @endverbatim
*        An expression does not have a unique RPN translation, e.g. 
*         `4 * (3 + 2)` can also be evaluated as `3 2 + 4 *`.  
*        This relies on automatically lifting the stack after each 
*        calculation to make space for new operands. More details
*        on how it works in each method's documentation.
*
*        After you read each method's docs, you can refer to the
*        following python code for the general implementation of a
*        RPN calculator. The way the HP35 differentiates itself is
*        via its internals (stack of 4 elements, LASTX, general
*        registers etc.).
*

*        - IBackend; to implement its abstract methods
*        - Subject; to be an observable subject by the Observer class
